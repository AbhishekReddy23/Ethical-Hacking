# Ethical-Hacking Lab Assignment 

This repository contains the work submitted as  Ethical Hacking Lab assignment . 

The project was divided into two main parts:

Development of a Vulnerable Machine:
As Group 17, we designed and configured a custom virtual machine with multiple realistic vulnerabilities such as SSH brute-force, SUID misconfiguration, Redis exploitation, PATH hijacking, Docker escape, and SUID-root binary abuse. The machine was intended to simulate a real-world pentesting challenge for peer students.

Penetration Testing on a Peer Machine:
We were later assigned a different machine developed by another student group. Our task was to perform full penetration testing — from enumeration to post-exploitation — and document all steps leading to root access.

The goal of this assignment was to provide hands-on experience in both creating secure environments with intentional flaws and practicing professional-level penetration testing methodology.


 Skills Gained

* Network and service enumeration (nmap, dirb, sqlmap, Hydra)
* Web exploitation (SQL injection, file upload vulnerabilities)
* Reverse shell creation and TTY stabilization
* Privilege escalation techniques:

  * SUID misconfiguration
  * Redis exploitation
  * PATH hijacking & sudo abuse
  * Docker escape
  * SUID-root binary exploitation
* Password hash cracking (John the Ripper)
* Vulnerable machine design for CTF-style scenarios
* System hardening awareness (sudoers, Docker, file permissions)
* Team collaboration and technical reporting
